    <h2>Simple Is Best</h2>
    <p>Children’s nutrition is the cornerstone of what we do. We know
    children’s palates are not as developed as teens or adults so we take great
    strides to ensure the menus are simple yet tasty. We serve the foods you
    grew up on, and we do it in proper portions with healthy ingredients to
    create a menu that is balanced and appealing for the child.</p>
