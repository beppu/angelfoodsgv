    Big Month Menu on top
    Dynamic Order Form below that
      add/remove child row
        child has
          name grade food*day
            food*day is going to be a long 1 dimensional table
            whose cells can be clicked on and off.
    PayPal Hand off
    Order Receipt
      Since we're going to use an accountless model, ahhh fuck.
      Should people be able to see their past orders?  Perhaps,
      the answer is that seeing their transaction history through
      PayPal is good enough.

    The Admin
      list of months
        set current month
        month/year -> menu edit
          entree price
          double price
        number of orders
          -> view daily order summary
        amount of money made
          -> view individual orders
            list of orders by showing id name date_of_order
              -> list of kids and what food was bought for them

Interesting Design Decision
  No accounts.  Orders are individual.
  However, we use sessions to remember who their kids were so that
  their next order will be more streamlined.

Data Model
  Menu (monthly menu container)
  MenuItem (item in menu)
    type: [ Food | Dismissal | Holiday ]
  Purchase (purchase container)
  PurchaseItem (person + food + price)

Technical Challenge?  Maybe
  How many days in a month?
  Which month should be displayed?
  Finding the next month.
  How do I submit a custom order description and order price to PayPal?
